# Zipping a Folder with Optional Password Protection

## Description
This program zips a specified folder and its contents into a `.zip` file. It allows for optional password protection using AES encryption. If no password is provided, a standard zip file is created. The user can also specify a custom name for the zip file.


## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Install the required `pyzipper` module for password protection (if needed) using the command: 
- pip install pyzipper
3.Save the script as assignment2_zip_folder.py.
4.Run the script using the command:
- python assignment2_zip_folder.py
5.Follow the prompts to enter:
- The path to the folder you want to zip.
- A custom name for the zip file (optional).
- A password for the zip file (optional).

## Expected Input/Output
- **Input**: 
1.Path to the folder you want to zip.
2.Custom name for the zip file (leave empty for default).
3.Password for the zip file (leave empty for no password).

- **Output**: 
1.A zip file created in the same directory as the specified folder, named according to the provided custom name or the folder's name.

## Error Handling
- The program checks if the provided folder path exists and is a directory.
- It handles cases where the pyzipper module is not installed when a password is requested.
- It raises errors for invalid inputs, such as empty passwords when password protection is requested.
